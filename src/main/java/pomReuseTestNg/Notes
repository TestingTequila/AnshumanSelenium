Approaches:

TDD[Test Driven Development]     -  (TestNg, Junit)Java, (MStest, Nunit)C#
Test NG is about 3 A's:
    @Annotations
      -These are always used with methods
      -They always starts with @
      @BeforeSuite
      @BeforeTest
      @BeforeClass
      @BeforeMethod  : This will be executed before every method with @Test annotation
      @Test          : This is used to represent the Test Case
      @AfterMethod  : This will be executed after every method with @Test annotation
      @AfterClass
      @AfterTest
      @AfterSuite
      ------------------------------------------
      @Parameters
      @DataProviders
      -----------------------------------------

    Attributes
     -They are used along with @Annotations
     -Priority
     -Enabled
     -TimeOut
     -dependsOnMethods
     -groups
     -dependsOnGroups
     -alwaysRun
     -invocationCount

    Assertions
     -assertTrue
     -assertFalse
     -assertEquals
     -assertNotEquals
